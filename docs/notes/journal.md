# Runway Compass – Engineering Journal

Use this journal to capture durable insights that don’t belong in GitHub issues or the decision log. Examples:

- Gotchas uncovered while integrating Google APIs.
- Performance measurements, troubleshooting steps, or heuristics worth revisiting.
- Links to reference material that helped unblock work.

Keep entries evergreen:

1. Start each entry with a short heading (e.g., `## 2025-10-22 – Sheets batching heuristics`).
2. Focus on knowledge that will help a future agent act faster; avoid day-to-day status updates (those belong in GitHub).
3. If an entry supersedes earlier advice, update or prune it so the journal stays trustworthy.

This journal is optional but encouraged—treat it as shared memory that makes the next task smoother.
