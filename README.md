## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo and install dependencies (instructions forthcoming with Milestone 0).
2. Configure Google Cloud credentials and environment variables (see `docs/engineering/process.md`).
3. Run the Next.js development server and authenticate with Google to select your private spreadsheet.
