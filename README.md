## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Follow the [local development setup guide](docs/engineering/setup.md) to prepare `.env.local` and Google Cloud credentials.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Subsequent milestones will enable Google authentication and spreadsheet connectivity.
